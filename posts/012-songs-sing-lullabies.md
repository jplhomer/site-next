Barrett is four months old. Here is my entire repertoire of lullaby songs to which he has the _absolute pleasure_ of listening before he slips off into a peaceful slumber.

Note: the set list varies from night to night, and I can't guarantee I know all the words to the songs. But he's paying me $0 for this performance, so I don't care.
